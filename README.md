### Code organization
The lib folder is organized as follows.
  * [lib/client](lib/client): contains all the logic for the client operations
    in the different (verifiable) PIR schemes. The file
    [lib/client/client.go](lib/client/client.go) contains the definition of the
    Client interface and general functions used to implement the client for
    different schemes. The other files contains the types and functions specific
    to each scheme.
  * [lib/constants](lib/constants):
  * [lib/database](lib/database):
  * [lib/dpf](lib/dpf):
  * [lib/field](lib/field):
